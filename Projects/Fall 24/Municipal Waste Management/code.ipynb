    "### Project Brief: Analysis of Municipal Waste Management in Urban Regions  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**  \n",
    "Municipal waste refers to waste collected and treated by or for municipalities, encompassing a wide range of sources such as households, commerce, small businesses, and public institutions. Typical waste includes yard waste, garden waste, street sweepings, and litter container contents. It does not, however, include waste from sewage systems or construction and demolition activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze municipal waste management across different regions, focusing on costs, waste composition, population characteristics, and municipal infrastructure. The study leverages data to understand the key factors influencing waste sorting, treatment, and disposal practices. The findings will help students develop insights into sustainable waste management practices and identify areas for improvement.\n",

    "### **Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze Cost Drivers of Waste Management**:\n",
    "   - Investigate the relationship between **waste management costs per capita (`tc`)** and municipal factors such as **population density (`pden`)**, **urbanization index (`urb`)**, and **waste generation per kmÂ² (`wden`)**.\n",
    "   - Identify which demographic, economic, and geographic factors most significantly influence waste management costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate Waste Sorting Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Examine the impact of sorted waste share (`sor`) on the **cost of sorted waste per capita (`csor`)** and overall waste management costs.\n",
    "   - Determine the role of fee schemes (`fee`, `d_fee`) and regional waste management practices (`s_wteregio`, `s_landfill`) in improving sorting efficiency and reducing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assess Regional Variations in Waste Management Practices**:\n",
    "   - Compare waste management costs across different regions (`region`, `province`) and evaluate how **regional infrastructure (`roads`, `proads`)** and **economic indicators (`gdp`, `wage`)** affect these costs.\n",
    "   - Identify disparities in waste-to-energy usage (`s_wteregio`) and landfill dependency (`s_landfill`) between regions and their impact on waste management efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model and Predict Waste Management Costs**:\n",
    "   - Develop a regression model to predict **waste management costs per capita (`tc`)** based on key demographic, geographic, and economic features.\n",
    "   - Use feature importance analysis to recommend strategies for reducing costs while maintaining sustainable practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Provide Actionable Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Based on the analysis, propose data-driven recommendations to optimize waste management costs, improve sorting practices, and encourage sustainable waste treatment methods.\n"
