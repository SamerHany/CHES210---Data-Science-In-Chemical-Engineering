    "### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient supply chain management is crucial for businesses to ensure timely delivery of goods, reduce costs, and maintain customer satisfaction. Late deliveries can cause operational disruptions, affect customer loyalty, and increase expenses. Leveraging data-driven techniques, businesses can predict delivery times and identify potential risks of delays to enhance decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze a dataset from **DataCo Global**, which captures various aspects of the supply chain, including order details, shipping specifics, and customer information. By using machine learning models, we aim to predict delivery days and classify late delivery risks to improve operational efficiency and customer experience.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Predict Delivery Days**:\n",
    "   - Use regression techniques to predict the **number of delivery days**, calculated as the difference between `Order date` and `Shipping date`. This prediction can help businesses manage expectations and optimize shipping operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Classify Late Delivery Risk**:\n",
    "   - Build a classification model to predict the **risk of late delivery** based on factors like shipping mode, order region, and scheduled shipment days. This model will enable proactive measures to reduce delays and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these objectives, the project will provide actionable insights into delivery efficiency and risk management, which are vital for optimizing supply chain performance.\n",
