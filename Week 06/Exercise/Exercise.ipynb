    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Data visualization plays a crucial role in analyzing the performance of wastewater treatment plants. Different types of charts can help explore distributions, relationships, trends, and compliance rates, providing clear insights into the treatment process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Visualizations and Their Purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Univariate Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Histogram**: Shows the frequency distribution of a single variable, helping to understand its spread and identify any skewness or peaks in the data.\n",
    "   - **Box Plot**: Visualizes the spread and identifies potential outliers, indicating the variability of the process across different treatment stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bivariate Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Scatter Plot**: Helps examine relationships between two variables, such as input flow and effluent BOD, to reveal potential correlations or patterns.\n",
    "   - **Joint Plot**: Combines scatter plots and density plots, showing the correlation between two variables along with their marginal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multivariate Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Heatmap**: Visualizes correlations among multiple variables, providing insights into which variables are strongly or weakly related to each other.\n",
    "   - **Pair Plot**: Shows pairwise relationships between variables, helping to understand how multiple variables interact simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Series Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Line Plot**: Displays trends over time, helping to identify seasonal variations, trends, or anomalies in treatment performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Evaluation**\n",
    "   - **Bar Plot of Compliance Rates**: Shows the percentage of time the effluent met discharge standards, providing insights into overall compliance."
