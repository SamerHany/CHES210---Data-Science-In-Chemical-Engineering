    "## Objective\n",
    "The main objective of this case study is clean and analyze the collected data before moving to the model development stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "- Combine the 2 provided files into 1 dataset\n",
    "- Identify and handle missing data points, outliers, or inconsistencies\n",
    "- Validate data against physical and practical constraints\n",
    "- Use appropriate data visualization methods to study the distribution of each parameter\n",
    "- Use appropriate data visualization methods to study the effect of each parameter on the reaction product\n",
